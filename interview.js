  {
    text: "Do you need someone who treats coding like solving puzzles, not just writing syntax?",
    explanation:
      "I approach every problem by understanding the 'why' first. Whether it's optimizing a MongoDB query or building accessible interfaces, I dig deeper than surface-level solutions.",
  },
  {
    text: "Want a MEVN stack developer who's actually confident with MongoDB aggregations?",
    explanation:
      "I've built real applications using MongoDB's aggregation pipeline for complex data processing, not just basic CRUD operations. Vue 3 + Node.js + Express is my comfort zone.",
  },
  {
    text: "Need fresh eyes that won't suggest jQuery for everything?",
    explanation:
      "I keep up with modern web standards. I know when to use vanilla JS, when Vue 3's Composition API makes sense, and when a library is actually needed vs. when it's just convenient.",
  },
  {
    text: "Looking for someone who understands Web3 beyond just 'blockchain = cool'?",
    explanation:
      "I'm a junior Solidity developer who's built smart contracts and understands gas optimization, not just someone who read about crypto on Twitter.",
  },
  {
    text: "Want a developer who asks 'why' before 'how'?",
    explanation:
      "I've learned that understanding the business problem first leads to better technical solutions. I ask questions that might seem obvious but often aren't.",
  },
  {
    text: "Need someone who writes accessible code, not just code that works?",
    explanation:
      "I built a Braille learning app with full screen reader support and keyboard navigation. Inclusive design isn't a nice-to-have for me - it's a feature.",
  },
  {
    text: "Want someone who's built real solutions people actually use?",
    explanation:
      "My Braille learning app (dotyÂ·touch) solves a real problem for visually impaired learners. I build with purpose, not just to add to my portfolio.",
  },
  {
    text: "Looking for a developer who debugs with curiosity, not frustration?",
    explanation:
      "I improved website performance by 30% in my last role because I got curious about why things were slow, not just frustrated that they were.",
  },
  {
    text: "Need someone who collaborates with designers, not fights them?",
    explanation:
      "I've worked closely with design teams to implement pixel-perfect UIs while suggesting improvements for better user experience and technical feasibility.",
  },
  {
    text: "Want a developer who learns new tech because projects demand it, not for the resume?",
    explanation:
      "I learned Solidity because I wanted to build decentralized solutions, not because 'Web3' looked good on LinkedIn. I pick up tools when they solve problems.",
  },
  {
    text: "Looking for someone who can explain technical decisions to non-technical stakeholders?",
    explanation:
      "I can break down why we should use server-side rendering or why certain database choices matter, in terms that make business sense.",
  },
  {
    text: "Need a developer who sees inclusive design as a feature, not a nice-to-have?",
    explanation:
      "Accessibility improvements often lead to better UX for everyone. My inclusive approach has improved user engagement across all user groups in past projects.",
  },
